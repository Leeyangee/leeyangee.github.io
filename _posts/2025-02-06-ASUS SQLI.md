好长一段时间没更新关于实战的内容了，这段时间一直在钻研 kernel 的知识，还是需要拾起一下老本行. 

在上周发现 ASUS 某系列路由中的某个动态链接库的函数 api 存在 SQL injection 漏洞，并且观测到该漏洞在某个系列中至少已经存在了六年之久，因此想将该漏洞作为专门的对于 lib 安全的文章.

目前已经发现 GT-AC 路由系列的 web api 中基于该库造成的远程 Authenticated SQLi(RCE in specified situation when user turns on a specific debugging mode)

## [](#header-3)A report on the ASUS Routers Vuls in /usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so sqlite_Stat_hook caused SQL Injection in multiple series(Or even RCE in specified situation)

Vulnerability Product: GT-AC5300、GT-AC2900、specified versions in GT-AX and other versions that have not yet been discovered  
Vulnerability Test Firmware Version: GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w (latest)  
Vulnerability type: SQL Injection(Or even RCE in specified situation)  

There is a SQL Injection in ASUS specified lib `/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so`. When an attacker has a low privilege account of the remote router system(Triggering this vulnerability on some router firmware may not require any permissions), the attacker could trigger SQL injection through the lib api: `/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so`.`sqlite_Stat_hook`(On the GT-AC5300 the remote attacker calling path is `/usr/sbin/httpd`.`appGet.cgi`.`bwdpi_appStat` -> `/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so`.`sqlite_Stat_hook`), and even cause RCE in specified situation

### [](#header-3)Bin re and Lib re:

Some ASUS router firmwares are ubifs (UBI file system) file systems. For example, the following example is GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w. You only need to install ubireader and binwalk to easily extract the firmware file system. I will not go into details.  

Let's directly focus on `libbwdpi_sql.so`. The basic information about the library is as follows

![asus](/image/asus_sql/10.png)  
```
类别:                        ELF32
数据:                        2 补码，小端序 (little endian)
Version:                     1 (current)
OS/ABI:                      UNIX - System V
ABI 版本:                    0
类型:                        DYN (共享目标文件)
系统架构:                    ARM
```

I will not go into details about the discovery process of the libbwdpi_sql.so. You can see that the call stack is as follows: `libbwdpi_sql.so` is essentially the function interface of `libsqlite3.so.0.8.6`

```
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so        sqlite_Stat_hook
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so        j_bwdpi_appStat
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so        bwdpi_appStat
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so        j_sql_get_table
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6    sqlite3_get_table
...
```

let's just directly focus on the `sqlite_Stat_hook` in `/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so`, you can find that the param `client` just was simply formatted into `where` without any further filter when `client != "all"` is true. (the following Figure 3).  

![asus](/image/asus_sql/3.png)  
`Figure 3`  

And if `v13 != 0` is true, it means `a1 == 0 && _IF_mode_e_detail_then_0` is true. `IF_mode_e_detail_then_0 = _IF_mode_e_detail_then_0 = strcmp(mode, "detail")` is true. so `mode != "detail" && a1 == 0`  

and where is the `a1` comes from? `a1` is actually the first parameter of the function `sqlite_Stat_hook`

```c
int __fastcall sqlite_Stat_hook(int a1, const char *client, const char *mode, unsigned int dura, const char *date, _DWORD *a6, FILE *a7);
```

But don't worry, in most cases, the first parameter of the router firmware calling this function is 0, as shown in the example GT-AC5300 I will give below

![asus](/image/asus_sql/8.png)  

Let's focus on the most important parameter `where`. what happend to `where` ? You can see that when `mode == "hour" && dura == 24` is true, `where` is called as the third parameter to `j_bwdpi_appStat` (the following Figure 4)

![asus](/image/asus_sql/4.png)  
`Figure 4`  

Then, let's see what happend in `j_bwdpi_appStat`. `j_bwdpi_appStat` call the `bwdpi_appStat` with the original parameters (the following Figure 5)

You can clearly find that when `having != NULL && where[0] != NULL` is true, the `where` is directly formatted into the `sql_query` and the SQL statement is executed without any filtering, resulting in SQL injection vulnerability (the following Figure 6)

![asus](/image/asus_sql/5.png)  
`Figure 5`  

![asus](/image/asus_sql/6.png)  
`Figure 6`  

Then what's the `j_sql_get_table`? Does `j_sql_get_table` set any bypass or ORM processing for sql? Further tracking found that `j_sql_get_table` calls `sqlite3_get_table`, `sqlite3_get_table` is actually an interface function located in `/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6` as a Cpl interface. its definition is as follows

```c
int sqlite3_get_table(
  sqlite3 *db,          /* An open database */
  const char *zSql,     /* SQL to be evaluated */
  char ***pazResult,    /* Results of the query */
  int *pnRow,           /* Number of result rows written here */
  int *pnColumn,        /* Number of result columns written here */
  char **pzErrmsg       /* Error msg written here */
);
void sqlite3_free_table(char **result);

//This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility. Use of this interface is not recommended.
//Definition: A result table is memory data structure created by the sqlite3_get_table() interface. A result table records the complete query results from one or more queries.
//The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns. But these numbers are not part of the result table itself. These numbers are obtained separately. Let N be the number of rows and M be the number of columns.
```

![asus](/image/asus_sql/12.png)  

Obviously, this function as a Cpl interface does not have any filtering, it just executes the second parameter and outputs the result

So in theory, when you call the function in this form, it will trigger SQL injection or even RCE. Of course, this is the calling method for local command execution, and it must be combined with different APIs of each router to achieve remote command execution.

```c
sqlite_Stat_hook(0, "[SQLi Payload]", "hour", "24", [Irrelevant parameters], [Irrelevant parameters], ...)
```

`A possible local call POC is as follows`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

typedef void (*sqlite_Stat_hook_t)(int type, char *client, char *mode, char *dura, char *date, int *retval, void *wp);

int main() {
    void *handle = dlopen("/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    ...[Omitted]...

    sqlite_Stat_hook_t sqlite_Stat_hook = (sqlite_Stat_hook_t)dlsym(handle, "sqlite_Stat_hook");
    if (!sqlite_Stat_hook) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error loading function: %s\n", dlerror());
        dlclose(handle);
        return 1;
    }

    sqlite_Stat_hook(0, "[SQLi Payload]", "hour", "24", "1000", &retval, NULL);
    dlclose(handle);

    return 0;
}
```

Next, I discovered an even more bizarre vulnerability, which even has the opportunity to exploit RCE after SQL injection.

if `/tmp/BWSQL_LOG` exists, the `sql_query` will be formatted into command and executed directly, causing RCE (the following Figure 7)

![asus](/image/asus_sql/7.png)  
`Figure 7`  

But it is difficult to make `/tmp/BWQL_LOG` exist, so no further discussion will be made here

### [](#header-3)Bin re and Lib re and Simulation:

Example firmware download: [GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w](/image/asus_sql/GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w)

The firmware took me a very long time to simulate and run, and I spent most of my time to find a way to running it. Sometimes strange errors suddenly appear, and I will not go into details here. For problems with ASUS router simulation, you can refer to this article for assistance. (Given that the complexity of this firmware simulation is not at a low level, user-mode simulation is not recommended.)

[iotsec-zone 模拟启动ASUS华硕路由器的http服务](https://www.iotsec-zone.com/article/304)

Please note that there are several places where links are not mentioned: 

1. Before running the simulation, you need to modify the img size to 32gb, enter the following command:  
  `qemu-img resize ./debian_wheezy_armhf_standard.qcow2 32G`

2. For SSL certificate generation, you can directly generate an SSL certificate in the physical machine and then put it in the virtual machine. Generating a certificate in a virtual machine will cause many problems

Since some conditions are difficult to implement in a virtual machine, I chose to directly run the `sqlite_Stat_hook` by modifying the PC register and function parameters(reg R0、R1、R2 ... ) in pwndbg instead of writing a C code to link and debug it.

Please attention, enter the parameter -S -gdb tcp::1234 before qemu boot kernel to facilitate pwndbg debugging later

Once you start the pwndbg, please set following break points

```
b *0x176c8 (this is the 'main' of httpd)
b *0x16a6c (this is the interface func of 'sqlite_Stat_hook')
```

![asus](/image/asus_sql/13.png)  

After boot the kernel, attach the virtual machine before run httpd.

then, modify the root to the firmware root that you uploaded, and input following command in your pwndbg

```
target remote 127.0.0.1:1234
c
(here you need to modify the root, run httpd cmd in virtual machine)
(break at main)
set $r0=0
set {char[16]} 0x10a20 = "\"OR\"1\"=\"1"
set $r1=0x10a20
set {char[16]} 0x10a30 = "hour"
set $r2=0x10a30
set {char[16]} 0x10a40 = "24"
set $r3=0x10a40
set $pc=0x16a64
c
(break at the interface of 'sqlite_Stat_hook')
s
```

### [](#header-3)Bin re and Lib re and Investigation:

After investigation, it was found that the injection vulnerability of the SQL library has existed for at least six years, The following is a search for the possible source code of the same dynamic link library, which was pulled by a user on GitHub six years ago. It clearly shows that the splicing vulnerability has existed for at least six years.

[https://github.com/smx-smx/bcm63138/blob/efd289adf8f0ea2b6c618dc7a427eb37026fc4e1/package/asus_bwdpi_source/src/asus_sql/sqlite_stat.c#L226](https://github.com/smx-smx/bcm63138/blob/efd289adf8f0ea2b6c618dc7a427eb37026fc4e1/package/asus_bwdpi_source/src/asus_sql/sqlite_stat.c#L226)

![asus](/image/asus_sql/9.png)  

Even a few years ago, you can observe that there is no echo debug statement in the lib that is vulnerable to RCE, as shown below. A few years later, ASUS not only added the echo' debug statement that is more prone to RCE vulnerability, but also did not fix this obvious vulnerability.

## [](#header-3)Firmware re:

 (Take the GT-AC5300 as an example)

There happens to be a latest version of the GT-AC5300 router firmware that uses this lib and passes its web parameters into sqlite_Stat_hook, so I will analyze the firmware next

Some ASUS router firmwares are ubifs (UBI file system) file systems. For example, the following example is GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w. You only need to install ubireader and binwalk to easily extract the firmware file system. I will not go into details.

Firmware download: [GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w](/image/asus_sql/GT-AC5300_3.0.0.4_386_51569-g9ee6a79_ubi.w)

Firstly let's see the function of web api `bwdpi_appStat` in `/usr/sbin/httpd`, I call it `T_danger_SQL` here. (the following Figure 1)

you can find that here it received GET args from user, Then call `sqlite_Stat_hook` with the `client`, `mode`, `dura`, `date` received from the user as parameters(the following Figure 2), please attention that here is no any filter

In the following steps, you will find that the param `client` is not filtered until the end

![asus](/image/asus_sql/1.png)  
`Figure 1`  

![asus](/image/asus_sql/2.png)  
`Figure 2`  

You can directly inject malicious payload into the where parameter, causing SQL injection or even RCE. The only drawback is that authorization is required to call this function in GT-AC5300. 

You can see that the call stack is as followss

```
/appGet.cgi?hook=bwdpi_appStat()    Web interface
/usr/sbin/httpd                     T_danger_SQL(Self-naming function)
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so            sqlite_Stat_hook
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so            j_bwdpi_appStat
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so            bwdpi_appStat
/usr/lib/libbwdpi_sql.so            j_sql_get_table
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6        sqlite3_get_table
...
```

### [](#header-3)HARM: 

When an attacker has a low privilege account of the system, the attacker could trigger SQL injection through the `bwdpi_appStat` in `appGet.cgi`, attacker could SQL Inject by blind injection (such as time based injection, boolean based injection), and even cause RCE in specified situation
